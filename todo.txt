# New TODO
- Add door
- Make door goal
- Reaching goal ends level and loads next level (level`x` where x++)
- Add "testing" to builder (add character and allow playing of level)
    - when level ends in editor, end "test" and resume editing
- Add reset button to builder (deletes everything and resets to center block)
